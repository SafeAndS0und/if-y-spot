With **totallynotspotify** I was primarily aiming for a pleasing visual impression. 
That why I was shamelessly stealing Spotify's design and some other dribbble ideas. I'm not a graphic designer - I gathered. 
Well it also works. And I think it works really well. I didn't plan it to, so in the end it doesn't use any state management solution except for simple props, custom hooks and components. It's still just a demo, many things could have been done better.
